# Securing_data_using_CNN
Securing data using CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) may not be the most suitable approach, as CNNs are primarily used for image analysis tasks such as object recognition and computer vision. However, I am providing information on securing data of images there are different approaches involved in the process but i prefrered the combination of data using CNN and steganography.

**Steganography** is the practice of concealing information within other data (in this case, images) in a way that is not **easily detectable.** In the context of image data, steganography techniques can embed secret messages or data within the image pixels or their properties.

**Steganalysis** 
using CNN involves training the network on a large dataset of normal (non-steganographic) images and steganographic images, enabling it to learn features that distinguish between the two. The trained CNN can then be used to identify if an image contains hidden data.

CNNs are powerful at extracting meaningful features from images. By utilizing a **pre-trained CNN model** (such as VGG, ResNet, or Inception), features can be extracted from both the cover (original) image and the steganographic image. These features can capture high-level patterns and details that may indicate the presence of hidden data.

 Using the extracted features, a classification model can be trained to **distinguish between normal and steganographic images**. This model can be trained using supervised learning techniques, where labeled datasets of normal and steganographic images are used to teach the model to differentiate between them.

 Once the classification model is trained, it can be used to detect whether an image contains hidden information. By analyzing the image with the trained model, it can identify **potential steganographic content and raise an alert if hidden data is detected.** This can aid in identifying unauthorized or malicious use of steganography.
